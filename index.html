  <p class = "quotes">"Batman: Black. All important movies start with a black screen. And music.
    Edgy, scary music that would make a parent or studio executive nervous. And logos.
    Really long and dramatic logos. Warner Bros. Why not Warner Brothers? I dunno. DC.
    The house that Batman built. Yeah, what Superman? Come at me bro.
    I'm your kryptonite. Hmm, not sure what RatPac does but that logo is macho.
    I dig it. Okay, get yourself ready for some... reading.
